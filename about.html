                <h2>Scientific pirates</h2>
                <p>This year let's imagine that you are a researcher who travels around the World and through time on
                    your super ship, solving challenging tasks in order to find the most wanted treasure (beer case)!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> A quest is a set of tasks and questions that you have to solve in order to find something or
                    whatever. There are thousands of different quest types. In the Nasty Quest you will be given 15
                    tasks in different scientific fields. You have to be creative, notice details and try to interpret
                    them logically.</p>
                <br>
                <span>REWARD</span>
                <p>The best team, which has the highest amount of points, will get a <b>beer case</b> as a reward.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span>Participation</span>
                <p>You can go through the tasks alone or build a team of 2-3-4-5 people. You can also give your team a
                    name, vote for a leader, or someone in your team may just say you that he/she is the leader, so be
                    tolerant, also of a dictatorship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Participating alone or as a team, you have to sign up yourselves, filling in the <a
